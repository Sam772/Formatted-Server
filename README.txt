Instructions to run the program:

1. Open your Java IDE (Eclipse/Intellij).

2. Run the FormattedServer.java class.

3. Run the FormattedClient.java class.

4. In the Java console on the FormattedClient, you should be given a prompt to input a message, hence input a message.

5. Again on the FormattedClient you should be given another prompt to input a format, uppercase or lowercase.

6. Either type uppercase or lowercase and see the returned message back on the FormattedClient.

7. To test multiple threads, it is best to use command prompt, ensure you are within the correct directory, this can either be the root directory or the directory where the FormattedServer, FormattedClientHnadler, and FormattedClient java files are.

8. Run the FormattedServer.java class on your IDE.

9. Open a couple of command prompt windows and cd into the directory as mentioned previously, type "java FormattedClient.java" or "java src\FormattedServer\FormattedClient.java" to run the FormattedClient on both command prompt windows.

10. Interact with the program as normal, on the FormattedServer.java class java console window, you should see the messages clients are inputting.

NOTE: If you wish to run multiple instances via cmd, you can do so from the root directory or in the "src/FormattedServer" directory, there is a duplicated Keys on purpose to make it easier to run cmd windows from there, however either way works.
